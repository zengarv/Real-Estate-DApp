# Blockchain Real Estate Platform

This repository contains the codebase for a blockchain-based real estate platform designed to streamline property transactions through smart contracts. The platform offers a secure, transparent, and efficient way to list, buy, and manage properties using blockchain technology.

## Key Features

### Property Listing
- **Interface for Property Owners**: Allows property owners to list new properties with detailed information.
- **Detailed Property Listings**: Properties are displayed with comprehensive details, including descriptions, prices, and owner information.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search and filter properties based on criteria such as location, price, and amenities.

### Property Details Page
- **In-depth Property Information**: Each property has a dedicated page with detailed descriptions, price information, and owner's details.
- **Booking and Purchase Options**: Users can book or purchase properties directly from the property details page.

### User Dashboard
- **For Property Owners**: Manage listed properties, view bookings, and track sales.
- **For Buyers/Tenants**: View booking history, manage payments, and interact with property listings.

### Smart Contract Interactions
- **Property Listing and Management**: Smart contracts handle property listings, bookings, and ownership transfers.
- **Transaction Status**: Display transaction statuses and confirmations for users.

## User Authentication and KYC Verification
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure registration and login system.
- **KYC Verification**: Integration with KYC (Know Your Customer) services to verify user identities.

## Payment Processing
- **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Integration with cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for secure payments.
- **Transaction Handling**: Smart contracts manage payment processing and ensure secure transactions.

## Smart Contract Architecture

1. **UserManagement Contract**: Manages user profiles and ensures KYC compliance.
2. **PropertyListing Contract**: Handles property listings and interacts with the NFTProperty contract for tokenization.
3. **NFTProperty Contract**: Manages NFTs representing the properties, including features like royalties.
4. **Payment Contract**: Processes cryptocurrency payments within the platform.

## Integration

These contracts work together to create a cohesive system:
- **User Management** ensures user authentication and compliance.
- **Property Listing** interfaces with the **NFTProperty** contract to mint property tokens.
- **NFTProperty** manages the tokenized representation of properties.
- **Payment** processes and secures financial transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MetaMask (for testing payments)
- Solidity and Hardhat for smart contract development

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

### Deployment
Deploy smart contracts using Hardhat to a test network or mainnet as required.
